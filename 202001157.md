## Static Analysis - 
  1. Static analysis is a method of examining the source code of a software program without executing it. 
  2. Static analysis can help detect errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, and other quality issues in the code. 
  3. Static analysis tools can perform various tasks such as checking syntax, style, logic, data flow, control flow, and security. 
  4. Static analysis can improve the reliability, performance, and maintainability of software by identifying and correcting defects early in the development process.
  5. Some examples of static analysis tools are SonarQube, PMD, ESLint, and Pylint.


## Chosen Tool - Pylint
  1. Pylint is a static code analyser for Python 2 or 3.
  2. Pylint analyzes the code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for code smells, and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.
  3. Pylint is not trusting your typing and is inferring the actual value of nodes using its internal code representation (astroid). If your code is import logging as argparse, Pylint can check and know that argparse.error(...) is in fact a logging call and not an argparse call. 
  4. Pylint also has an ecosystem of existing plugins for popular frameworks and third party libraries.

The average score obtained by analyzing all the files with pylint is  = **6.10**

## Some of the common errors - 
  1. **Line too long** - Pylint considers the line length long if the number of characters exceeds than **100**, as seen in the 6th file **deposit.py**.
  2. **Missing module docstring** - When a module has no docstring(for documentation of methods and functions) i.e., empty modules has no docstring.
  3. **Too many branches** - When the number of branches increases than **12** it gives warning of too many branches as seen in 7th file **show_history**.
  4. **Import at the top** - Import instructions should be at the top of the file, if imported anywhere else it shows **wrong-import-position**.
